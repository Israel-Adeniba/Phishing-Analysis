# Phishing-Analysis
This will be done primarily within the Ubuntu Virtual Machine

Utilities
Mozilla Thunderbird <br />

We would require an actual email client so we can interract with email messages. <br />
We would preferrably use "Mozilla Thundrbird" which is a free and open source email client <br />
Open a terminal window > enter the command "sudo apt in stall thunderebird" <br />
<br />

<br />
Now that thunderbird has been installed, any ".eml or e-mail" files are automatically associated with the application <br />
Letts open up an email file <br />
On the desktop Open the Phishing Analysis folder > Header Analysis > Open sample1.eml  <br />

We need to be able to open email messages with linked images without automatically blocking them <br />
Open thunderird > Privacy & Security > Check "Allow remote content in messages <br />
