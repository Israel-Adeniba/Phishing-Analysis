# Phishing-Analysis
This will be done primarily within the Ubuntu Virtual Machine


Utilities
Mozilla Thunderbird <br />
Sublime text <br />


We would require an actual email client so we can interract with email messages. <br />
We would preferrably use "Mozilla Thundrbird" which is a free and open source email client <br />
Open a terminal window > enter the command "sudo apt in stall thunderebird" <br />
<br />

<br />
Now that thunderbird has been installed, any ".eml or e-mail" files are automatically associated with the application <br />
Letts open up an email file <br />
On the desktop Open the Phishing Analysis folder > Header Analysis > Open sample1.eml  <br />

<br />
<br />
We need to be able to open email messages with linked images without automatically blocking them <br />
Open thunderird > Privacy & Security > Check "Allow remote content in messages <br />

<br />
<br />

To do some manual email file and header analysis, we need a text and code editor not just to rely on the terminal for the full analysis <br />
We would be installing Sublime Text, an editor for code and different types of markup <br />
Open Firefox > search "sublime text" > Click the first result > Install for linux <br />

<br />
<br />
To install Sublime text, we would run the "gpg key" and install the package. <br />
Copy the GPG key, paste in the terminal <br />
Select the channek to use  by copying the "Stable" command <br />
